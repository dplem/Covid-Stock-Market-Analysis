# Covid-Stock-Market-Analysis

This is my Final Capstone project for the Thinkful Data Analysis Bootcamp where I explore the correlations between Covid-19 infection rate and stock market prices.

Problem: How to determine which stocks are most affected by the coronavirus?

Hypothesis: The stock market is inversely correlated with the infection rate of covid-19.

Process:

1. Pull coronavirus infection data by date
2. Download stock price information since the coronavirus infection began
3. Calculate correlation between confirmed cases and stock market prices
4. Evaluate percentage of market change for individual stocks
5. Data exploration into correlation between stock market price and infection rate
