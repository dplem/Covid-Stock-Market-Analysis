# Covid-Stock-Market-Analysis
Analysis of the correlations between Covid-19 infection rate and stock market prices.

This is my Final Capstone project for the Thinkful Data Analysis Bootcamp.

Problem: How to determine which stocks are most affected by the coronavirus?

Hypothesis: The stock market is inversely correlated with the infection rate of covid-19.

Process:

Pull coronavirus infection data by date
Download stock price information since the coronavirus infection began
Calculate correlation between confirmed cases and stock market prices
Evaluate percentage of market change for individual stocks
Data exploration into correlation between stock market price and infection rate
